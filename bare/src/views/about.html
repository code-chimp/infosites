        Hello, my name is Tim Goshinski and I live in <span title="Midwestern United States aka 'Flyover Country'">Omaha, Nebraska</span>
        with my lovely wife and amazing daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work primarily with front end JavaScript and .NET web applications, but I fancy myself to be more of a
        polyglot than I most likely am. I&#39;m not saying that I have been at this for a long time, but
        when I started out the term &#34;pair programming&#34; meant that I was tasked with writing
        our code in cuneiform on wet clay tablets while my partner warmed up the vacuum tubes in his armpits
        - ah, heady days those.
